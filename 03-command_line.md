### Q1.  Cheat Sheet of Commands  

Here's a list of items with which you should be familiar:  
* show current working directory path
* creating a directory
* deleting a directory
* creating a file using `touch` command
* deleting a file
* renaming a file
* listing hidden files
* copying a file from one directory to another

Make a cheat sheet for yourself: a list of at least **ten** commands and what they do.  (Use the 8 items above and add a couple of your own.)  

> > show current working directory path = pwd  
creating a directory = mkdir  
deleting a directory = rm =r  
creating a file = touch  
deleting a file = rm  
renaming a file = mv  
listing hidden files = ls -a  
copying a file from one directory to another = cp  
selecting all files in a directory = *  
listing files in long format = ls -l  
printing unique lines = uniq

`ls -a`  = lists all contents in a directory including hidden files  
`ls -l`  = lists all files in a directory in long format  
`ls -lh` = lists all files in a directory in long format with file size  
`ls -lah` = lists all contents in a directory including hidden files with file size  
`ls -t`  = lists all files by modification time  
`ls -Glp` = lists all files in long format without owner name and directories with /

### Q4.  Xargs   

What does `xargs` do? Give an example of how to use it.

> > xargs builds and executes command lines from standard input on one or more times with initial arguments.
As an example, the following command "$ echo 1 2 3 4 | xargs" will print 1 2 3 4 using xargs.
